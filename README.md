## Quick Start

* PHP 7.0+
* Composer

`composer require lullabot/mpx-php`

## Logging

This library will log API actions that are transparent to the calling code. For
example, calling code should handle logging of invalid credentials, while this
library will log if an authentication was automatically refreshed during an
API request that resulted in a `401`.

If your application does not wish to log these actions at all, use
`\Psr\Log\NullLogger` for any constructors that require a
`\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`.
