## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- `Notification` now has an `isSyncResponse()` method to determine if no
  further notifications are available. #154

### Changed

- Setting an account context for requests is now done by setting the account
  parameter in the `AuthenticatedClient` constructor. The account parameter has
  been removed from all methods in `DataObjectFactory`. #154

## [0.9.0] - 2018-12-12

### Added

- Allow any object with a public ID to be used for player URLs #152
- Player URIs can now be generated using media reference GUIDs instead of
  public IDs by calling `withMediaByGuid`, and back to public IDs by calling
  `withMediaByPublicId`. #153

### Changed

- `\Lullabot\Mpx\Service\Player\Url` now is immutable, following what
  `\Psr\Http\Message\UriInterface` does. All `set` methods are now `with`
  methods. #153
- The `media` parameter on the Url constructor is now an ObjectInterface and
  not just a PublicIdentifierInterface to support guid URLs. #153

## [0.8.3] - 2018-11-05

### Added

- Embeddable player URLs can now be generated with `setEmbed` #151

  params.

## [0.8.1] - 2018-10-29

### Added

- Support limiting the fields returned when selecting objects #147

## [0.8.0] - 2018-10-26

## [0.7.0] - 2018-10-09

  `\Lullabot\Mpx\Service\Player\Url`. #111

## [0.6.2] - 2018-07-17

### Added

- Methods that load data from mpx now support passing in HTTP client options to
  Guzzle. This is primarily useful for implementations wishing to pass custom
  headers in the request, such as `Cache-Control: no-cache` to intermediate
  proxies. #138

## [0.6.1] - 2018-07-05
## [0.6.0] - 2018-07-05

### Changed

- The library has been relicensed to MIT #136.
- `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\ObjectInterface::getCustomFields()` now returns
  an array of all custom field classes and does not take a namespace
  parameter. #135
- A custom field class is loaded in objects even if the response data does not
  contain any fields in that namespace. #135
- Fix not using the adapter's cache item #137

## [0.5.0] - 2018-06-21

### Added

- [#131] Link and Image data types from mpx are now supported. These are
  typically used in custom fields only.
- New date classes have been added to handle empty date fields. See the
  `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\DateTime` namespace for details.

### Changed

- PHP 7.1 is now the minimum required PHP version.
- All scalar properties in mpx data services classes are now nullable.
- All array properties in mpx data services default to an empty array.
- All date and time properties now return a
  `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\DateTime\DateTimeFormatInterface` instead of a
  `\DateTime` object.
- It is highly recommended to re-create custom fields classes from the console
  tool. This will ensure they do not cause unnecessary `\TypeError` exceptions
  to be thrown.
- Duration is now generated as a float instead of an integer.
- All traits for mpx data service objects have been removed to simplify updates
  using the console tool. This includes `AdPolicyDataTrait` and
  `PublicIdentifierTrait`.
- Rename IdInterface methods to prevent name and type conflicts #104

## [0.4.0] - 2018-06-08

### Added

- Usernames are now validated to have a leading directory component, such as
  `mpx/` #124
- Made `$objectListQuery` optional in `select()` and `selectRequest()`.
- `select()` now supports "Q Queries", which are slower but more expressive
  filters for mpx requests #129
- `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\QueryPartsInterface` has been added to allow other
  code to provide query parameters for select requests #129

### Changed

- The `description` field on mpx exceptions is now optional, as it is only
  included in client errors and not server errors #124
- `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\ByFields` has been split into two classes.
  `ByFields` now exclusively deals with `by<Field>` parameters. A new
  `\Lullabot\Mpx\DataService\ObjectListQuery` class handles ranges, sorts,
  and filters. #129
- `select()` and `selectRequest()` in DataObjectFactory now take a
  `ObjectListQuery` parameter instead of a `ByFields` parameter #129

## [0.3.0] - 2018-05-28

### Added

- Add `\Lullabot\Mpx\AuthenticatedClient::setTokenDuration` to set a limit for
  token lifetimes #125
- Add a method / interface for fetching the raw JSON response #126

## [0.2.0] - 2018-05-18

### Added

- Service URLs are now cached when loading objects and listening for
  notifications. #114
- Support for loading custom fields, including denormalizing into custom
  classes not shipped with this library. See the README for detailed
  documentation. #120
- Add a discovery interface for Custom Fields. #122

### Changed

- Fix broken range calculations for the end of a list of ranges #113
- `\Lullabot\Mpx\Service\IdentityManagement\UserInterface` has been added to
  simplify bridging user configuration from applications. #116
- `\Lullabot\Mpx\Service\AccessManagement\ResolveAllUrls` now follows what
  `\Lullabot\Mpx\Service\AccessManagement\ResolveDomain` does and has changed
  it's API as a result. #144
- The UnixMicrosecondNormalizer class has been renamed to
  UnixMillisecondNormalizer #115
- Fix using the number of entries in the current page instead of the total #118
